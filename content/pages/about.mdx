# Hi âœ¨

My name is mara - i was born in 2000 and grew up in bielefeld (nrw, germany). I
am a software developer and enthousiast, currently living in berlin, germany.
Right now i am working as rust backend developer at hum systems and studying
it security at th brandenburg in the spare time.

The *black boxes* of computer science are fascinating me - i like to research
and hack on things which are a bit more unusual than todo apps (compiler,
window manager, emulators..).  Everything that has to do with hardware,
language design, math & operating systems is just blowing my mind. Disclaimer:
I still have alot to learn to get somewhat proficient in those topics - i use
this as a platform to document my learning progress and to help and entertain
other interested folks - so if you find anything inacurate, please file an
issue at github and i'll fix it!

From a technical point of view: Im currently writing alot of stuff in **rust**
and sometimes in haskell (or other functional languages - i like functional
languages (even if i dont fully understand them yet)).
